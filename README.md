Here is a README file that explains the environment in a simple and easy-to-understand way:

**Welcome to our React and Express.js Development Environment!**

This environment is designed to help you develop and test your React and Express.js applications. Here's a brief overview of how to use it:

**Services**

* **db**: This service runs a MySQL database that our Express.js backend uses to store data.
* **backend**: This service runs our Express.js backend, which handles requests and sends responses to the frontend.
* **frontend**: This service runs our React frontend, which sends requests to the backend and displays the response.

**How to use it**

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start the services.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the React frontend in action.
4. Open another web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to see the Express.js backend in action.

**Environment Variables**

* `DATABASE_URL`: This variable sets the URL for our MySQL database. You can change it in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
* `REACT_APP_API_URL`: This variable sets the URL for our React frontend to send requests to the backend. You can change it in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

**Troubleshooting**

* If you encounter any issues, check the Docker logs by running `docker-compose logs` in the terminal.
* If you need to restart a service, run `docker-compose restart <service_name>` in the terminal.
